Questions:
Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	Yes, I'm happy with how the construction is going with my website. 
	Today, I worked on creating my shop page with a mock store. I'm working on creating images for fake clothes to be displayed and for it be as real as it can be. 

	I've decided to switch some things around as well. After studying some more artist's webpages, I found that most of their index.html
	pages are either a landing page for their tours or music and there really isnt much of a 'home' page. I thought that since I want to have a dedicated music page and I wont have any tour dates,
	that I should rethink my home page. I decided to make my index page a landing page that is interactive and more artsy than most normal webpage index's. The landing page will re-direct directly
	 to the music page via an animaiton using JavaScript. This ensures that my users have a unique experience when first visiting my webpage, then are defaulted to the music page, which would act 
	 as a normal 'index.html' because it is the main content of my art/artist. I know this may be a unique approach to the requirements of the final assignment but I hope you can appreciate that 
	 my webpage is not a "normal" webpage as its more artistically focused. This has challenged me greatly with styling and JavaScript.

Is there anything you need from me?
	
Feedback/Fixes:
Rene: 	Jake, looking at other websites is a good idea and conceptually, I like what you did. When I first ran the project, I wanted more, though. Perhaps not just the logo, but also the name? Not sure what, just something. Think about making the entire page clickable instead of just the logo.  

Is it a limitation of Spotify that if I play and then pause an audio, the Get Spotify shows?

Especially on the small screen can you move your socials_container up? I cannot enter an email. It's like your input is readonly or disabled. 



When I ran your project using the "run" option in VS Code, I got this warning:

WARNING: Processing source-maps of https://widget.sndcdn.com/widget-6-5eb2cb4aa6fd.js took longer than 11000 ms so we continued execution without waiting for all the breakpoints for the script to be set.WARNING: Processing source-maps of https://widget.sndcdn.com/widget-8-006be1acba9c.js took longer than 988.6116999999995 ms so we continued execution without waiting for all the breakpoints for the script to be set.Could not read source map for https://widget.sndcdn.com/widget-6-5eb2cb4aa6fd.js: Unexpected 503 response from http://ent/web-sourcemaps/widget-6-5eb2cb4aa6fd.js.map: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND ent
When I run it using Live Server, then everything is fine. Do you have your project on github? It should be and you should have included the url with this submission.

You are making good progress.

Fixes:  
	I am working on making the landing page work more user friendly, but am running into trouble with some image stuff. 

	Unfortunately, yes, the spotify embed is defaulted to that property once music is paused. 

	I moved my socials bar up becuase it was being covered by the footer. I could also have made use of index's but i like the new position better as its more in the field of view of the user instead of hiding in the corner. 

	I have made additions of JavaScript to the store an email subscription. 
	I added in my font of my actual branding to the header and some head elements for better theme. 

	I tried hard to utilize the skills we have learned in our assignments and implement them in aspects of my project. This is seen on the About Me page with a slide show. Also on the shop page with JavaScript saving information into session and retrieving it on a result page. 

	I am not sure of the issues with my project not running in vs code, but I have been using Live Server for all of my developement. I will troubleshoot this issue. 

	I have added my repository to github, although I find the github tools in vs code hard to follow. It wants me to commit all of my files in my AdvWeb folder instead of letting me select a project.

Questions:
Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	If yes, why?
	Yes, I am quite pleased at the moment. I feel that I've gotten a good start and base code/styling done
	so I can focus more on the implementation of JavaScript in the next assignments. I'm still not sure what I want my
	home index page to be but I played around with embeding Spotify and Soundcloud players which I will move to the Music page eventually.
	Since the main idea of this website is to be a landing page, the nav links take care of most of the directing and info for my page.
	I'm thinking I will try to make the home index more artistic and design focused instead of information and written info like a typical webpage might be.

	If no, why?
Is there anything you need from me?

Feedback/Fixes:
Rene: 	Jake, looking good. Your label for="email_list" does not match the id for what it is for. Also make the email input type="email" instead of text. That will give some rudimentary validation and on a mobile device should bring up the keyboard with the @ sign.
Fixes:  I changed the label for the email list to match the input and changed its type to "email".

Questions:
Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	If yes, why?
    Yes, I am pleased with my outline and vision for my project. It is an idea I have had for many years and am excited to be able to create it and make it exist 
	by my own hand and not some webpage drag and drop program like Wix or Squarespace. 

	If no, why?
Is there anything you need from me?
At this moment, no. 

Feedback/Fixes:
Rene: 	Jake, I am glad this project excites you! Your project is a definite go. Do you have a favorite bird? I never tire of seeing bald eagles and pileated woodpeckers,
 but I enjoy all birds. I don't know about Spotify, but to embed YouTube videos does not take JavaScript. The subscription page could use JavaScript. At this point, 
 a media shop would be a simulation. But once you get to Apps Dev, you make a website that has a database (for storing customer information), so shopping would be more real.
  I know that one of Andy's assignments (PHP, I think) does a shopping cart. You analyses of Kaivon and San Holo are spot on. Some animation can be done with only CSS.

Fixes:  Thank you for your approval! I do have a favorite bird: the Macaw. I highlight this within my brand logo using the iconic macaw beak as my focus point. 
I have looked into the Spotify embed and it can be done with JavaScript so I will aim to do so. I'm also happy with having my shop page be just a mock-up of what would eventually 
be a fully-functioning shopping page after I learn those skills later in my program. I intend to upkeep and maintain this webpage to use as my own after this assignment as well, 
so future proofing will come into play too. I think the animation will test my css skills quite well.
